# Picarro analysis for the bronkhorst mixing setup, 03/02/26

5/6 bags have me made:
- Bag 1: 100 ppm CH4 (Base gas (air): 0.4 L/min, Low flow (gas): 8.163 mL/min)
- Bag 2: 100 ppm CH4 (Base gas (air): 0.4 L/min, Low flow (gas): 8.163 mL/min)
- Bag 3: 100 ppm CO2 (Base gas (air): 0.4 L/min, Low flow (gas): 8.163 mL/min)
- Bag 4: 0 ppm at the end of the pump
- Bag/outlet 5: 0 ppm from the lab synthetic air of the RIVER lab
- Bag 6: 0 ppm Synthetic air from our bottle

Informations: 
RIVER Picarro setup: CO2 is checked every month, there is no drift. We expect no drift for CH4 as well but it's an assumption.

Conclusion:
- CH4 100 ppm mix creates bag with less CH4 than expected. 
- CO2 100 ppm mix indicates around 100 ppm (around 97ppm) but is due to the fact that the synthetic contains around 10 ppm of CO2. Therefore, in both cases, it's a systematic error and the system creates bags with less concentration of mix than expected.
- Synthetic air from SENSE bottle have hight amount of CO2 isotope
- Gas from outlet of the Subocean pump is not the gas in the spectrometer, there is an entry of atmospheric air somewhere in the line, probably at the pump head.
